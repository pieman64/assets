# Assets Self-Listing
Please follow these steps to add your token's logo and additional information to our assets database which will be used across our products, notably the information will be displayed on our exchange's dashboards & in Saturn Wallet. This helps our users research your token and ensures your community does not confuse your token with another.

# Before you proceed
We like to have a place where our community can easily find out information about your token & dicuss it, as a result we ask that you post an introduction/announcement thread in our forum's cryptocurrency section: https://forum.saturn.network please note this thread will be linked in our exchange and in Saturn Wallet. The forum post needs to be set up before you proceed, thanks!

## How to add your logo & additional information
* Step 1: Ensure you have a 200x200 logo on a transparent background in PNG format ready. For the best results, your logo should take up most of the canvas & you do not want to have a transparent margin around it.
* Step 2: Fork the project's repository.
* Step 3: Upload your token's logo to the relevant directory: Ethereum tokens go in assets/eth/logo/ whereas Ethereum Classic tokens go in assets/etc/logo/.
* Step 4: Add your token's information to the relevant JSON file: Ethereum tokens use assets/eth/tokens.json whereas Ethereum Classic tokens use assets/etc/tokens.json. Follow this format:
```
{
  "name": "Token Name",
  "address": "Token Address",
  "symbol": "Token Ticker",
  "decimals": Token Decimals,
  "logo": "https://github.saturn.network/BLOCKCHAIN/logo/YOUR_TOKEN_SYMBOL.png",
  "website": "Link to your website",
  "forum": "Link to your topic on https://forum.saturn.network/"
}
```
* Step 5: Create a Pull Request.
